				<h4>Our Work</h4>
				<p>Every year at school, we host Stuy Splash, a series of FIRST and STEM lectures given by teammates, alumni, and mentors. This year, attendance has grown to over 100 and weâ€™ve had the privilege of team 1807 and Canadian team 771 giving lectures! We graciously reciprocated, travelling to Ontario, Canada, to give a lecture at SWATposium, hosted by 771. We held a total of 18 lectures, covering everything from the basics of an FRC competition to the intricacies of computer vision and pneumatics. We also had a keynote speaker, Professor Hod Lipson, give a presentation about the progression of artificial intelligence and robotics throughout history. On top of that, many teams were able to network and connect with each other during lunchtime. Stuy Splash was a great success!</p>
