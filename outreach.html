				<p> Both locally and globally, Pulsites continued to inspire others to work together and nurture their communities, building the foundations for a successful future. Within our school, wehave worked with the administration to incorporate new robotics and computer engineering classes into the curriculum. For the past 4 years, we worked with the Chinese Urban Youth Robotics Alliance and other FRC teams to start nearly 50 rookie teams. Since then, we have hosted Chinese teams at our school every year, allowing them to use our lab and helping them during competition. This year we started Global Immersion of FIRST Teams (GIFT), creating teams in Cyprus, Rwanda, Norway, and more! Both of these initiatives serve the same purpose: to create sustainable FRC and FTC teams worldwide. We have spent countless hours mentoring other FIRSTteams. Over the course of the past couple of years, we have actively mentored 26 FRC teams, 12 FTC team and 7 FLL teams along with 7 other robotics teams. Every year, our team runs an event called StuySplash, where team members, alumni, mentors, and special guests give seminars to educate rookie FIRST teams. Our event has also inspired the Computer Science department to hold an event called CyberStuy, for middle school students.Members of our team arehelping to plan the event and will lead a workshop to introduce the students to robotics. </p>
