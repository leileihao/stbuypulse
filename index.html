				<span id="mainCaptionEmphasis">Hello, we are StuyPulse.</span> A robotics team based in Stuyvesant High School, NYC. We participate in the <strong><em>FIRST</em></strong> Robotics Competition, and international robotics tournament where we build large robots from scratch. We also have many outreach and volunteering initiatives in order to spread STEM around the community, holding many events in and outside our school to spread the name of <strong><em>FIRST</em></strong>, our team, and STEM. Everything we do is entirely student run, from building and machining the robot parts, to writing the code for the robot, to getting sponsorships and money in order to fund the expensive construction of our robots.

				<h3>Volunteering</h3>
				StuyPulse has many volunteering events throughout the community. We send many members to Bloomberg events in Park Restoration and community events around the city. We try to give back as much as possible, and spread the word of STEM and our team in the process.

				<h3>Outreach</h3>
				StuyPulse has many outreach initiatives within our community. We host events like StuySplash, a series of free STEM workshops, and go to Maker Faire to spread the word of our team, FIRST, and STEM. We have an annual book sale on our street corner, and even hold a "mini-Maker Faire" at a neighborhood Barnes and Noble's.
