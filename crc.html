				<h4>Our Work</h4>
				<p>During the summer, StuyPulse team
members flew to Zhengzhou, China to
participate in the China Robotics Challenge
for the fourth consecutive year. In China,
StuyPulseâ€™s goal was to help pre-rookie
teams become rookie teams and teach them
how to build and program a robot, from
start to finish. Team members visited a local
school to mentor and help two pre-rookie
teams, 9070 and 9061, with their robots.
Pulsites were able to help them wire their
electronics, code their robot, and fix
different mechanisms. Adris, our President
of Software Engineering, gave a workshop
about computer vision for members of both
local and international teams. At the
competition, Pulsites continued to help
novice teams with technical issues, such as
errors in their code. We were delighted to
see teams 9070 and 9061 make it to the
quarterfinals. Rafael also qualified and made
it all the way to semifinals. After a long week
of mentoring, Pulsites took an excursion to
visit different regions in China, such as the
Great Wall of China.</p>
